                        A mouse translates movement along a surface to movement of the cursor on a computer. An older style mechanical mouse uses a ball which rolls against a series of rollers inside the mouse to detect the direction the mouse is being moved. An optical mouse uses an LED or laser which works with a light sensor and microprocessor. The LED or laser produces light which bounces off the surface. The reflection is detected by the light sensor and the microprocessor analyses the created image. Changes in the images over time is converted very reliably into movement of the cursor on the screen, translating the direction and speed of the mouse movement. the buttons on the mouse are simple electronic switches that register the clicks and send the data to the computer. The scroll-wheel is a potentiometer which changes the resistance in a circuit based on the change of position. All of this data is sent to the computer (through wire or wireless receiver) which is deciphered via the driver files by the operating system.

                        A mouse allows you to interact with programs on the computer by moving a pointer around the screen and click on items to select or choose from a menu. The main affordances of a mouse are moving the pointer, left and right clicking and scrolling. The pointer is a little icon that moves around the screen, changing its look based on the available interactions. It can be moved by sliding the mouse around the surface. if you find that you get to the edge of the surface before reaching the edge of the screen the mouse can be lifted and repositioned. A mouse typically has two or three buttons left and right click and sometimes a scroll button. The left button is used to select, click on hyperlinks, drag and drop and do the most common interactions on the computer. the right click is used for extra options that are contextual for what you are clicking on. The third button is often to be found behind the scroll on the mouse. It is used to use the mouse’s movement to scroll the page rather than the scroll wheel - it is an accessibility option. Scrolling up or down a page, like on a web page or text document, is done by rolling the scroll-wheel in the middle. There is a possibility of extra buttons found on the sides of a mouse. Often the functionality of these buttons is able to be set by the user.

                        A keyboard is one of the most essential input devices to a computer. It was the first and remains the most useful method of interfacing with your computer. It is made up of many small keys that send a signal to the computer when depressed. The most commonly used keys are the alphabet characters and space. The keys are laid out in a specific pattern called "English US QWERTY" (named for the first 6 letter keys). There are also a series of other characters and number as well as some action keys. All of these keys have a specific code as defined by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many different ways that a keyboard can be engineered. One of the most common is a membrane keyboard using a dome switch. Dome switch keyboards use plastic domes to suspend the keys above a circuit board. When the key is depressed the plastic dome is flattened onto the board creating a circuit with conductive material on the underside of the dome. This sends a signal to the processor on the keyboard which converts it to the binary string to send to the computer. With combinations of keys the action key can alter the binary string of the letter key. An example of this is the shift key which alters one bit in the letter binary to switch the capitalisation.

                        There are many types of keys on a keyboard, the most common type are the letter keys. These keys work in a simple way, inputting the labeled letter, which can be capitalised by pressing them in combination with additional keys like <b>Shift</b> or <b>Capslock</b>. In some software programs, these may not type letters, but instead may perform an action. An example of this is how keys like <b>W</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>S</b>, and <b>D</b> keys are used instead to move a character around the screen in many games. Similar to these is the <b>Space</b> key. This key is used to input the space character when inputting letters to form words, or some other actions in different software programs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then there are the special characters and number keys. All of these have two labels per key, the bottom one being the main character, and the higher one being what character is sent when combined with the <b>Shift</b> key. An example of this is the <b>`</b> key, which becomes the <b>~</b> key when combined with <b>Shift</b>. Another type of key is the Action key, which alter the effect of another key, like the <b>Ctrl</b> key, which can be used to complete complex commands, such as <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>s</b> command, which saves a document. Another type of key on a keyboard are the Function keys, labeled as <b>F1</b>, <b>F2</b> and so on. These can be used for computer-specific commands, for example changing the volume. The last type of key is an Arrow key. These are labeled with arrows, and are used for text navigation mostly, but some programs can also use them for different, usually movement related actions.

                        The main parts of a speaker are the <b>cone</b> and <b>dust cap</b>, which move the air around to create sound vibrations, the <b>spider</b> and the <b>surround</b>, which hold the cone in place while allowing it to move, the <b>magnet</b> and <b>voice coil</b> which turn electricity into movement, to move the cone. Other elements include the <b>basket</b>, the <b>pole</b>, the <b>top plate</b>, and the <b>frame</b>. The way the voice coil works is by using the fact that when electricity is run through a coil it produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field moves the coil towards or away from a magnet, depending on its polarisation. When audio signals are sent through the coil, it is attracted and repelled by the permanent magnet on the speaker, depending on the height and polarity of the wave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Computers store sound files in digital formats, while sound waves themselves are an analog, physical form. The speaker needs to use a <b>Digital Analog Converter (DAC)</b> to turn the digital information stored in the sound file into electrical impulses that will cause the speaker to create an analog waveform within a specific frequency range, otherwise known as sound.

                        Speakers are fairly simple items to use, but there are many types. The most common type would be a speaker that is embedded inside a device, like those found in a laptop or a phone. For this kind of speaker, nothing additional is needed to be done to play audio, simply press the play button. Another common type of speaker is found in headphones and earbuds. for these to work, you must connect your device to them. Two common ways of doing this are with an audio jack, and an auxiliary cable or with a Bluetooth wireless connection. Another type is an external speaker, which like headphones or earbuds, can be connected using an auxiliary cable or Bluetooth, but these often need their own power source, which is a trait not often found in wired headphones/earbuds. One last type of speaker is that found in an amplifier. Amplifiers need to be plugged into an independent power source to function, and are most often connected directly to an instrument like an electric guitar or to a microphone to collect input. These inputs will most commonly be connected directly using a lead.

                        A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) Data Projector is the most common type of projector in modern use. This device uses a single lightbulb as its source of light. The light projected from this lightbulb is separated into red green and blue using dichroic mirrors. The coloured light is then reflected into an LCD screen which maps the respective red, green and blue values from each pixel, and the light is then recombined with a prism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data projectors, like regular computer displays, create images using pixels that each have their own RGB values, which represent a colour. For example RGB 0,0,0 is <span style="color:rgb(0,0,0);">black</span>, RGB 255,0,0 is <span style="color:rgb(255,0,0);">Red</span>, and an rgb value of 252,3,186 <span style="color:rgb(252,3,186);"> is a nice shade of pink</span>. There are many pixels arranged in an array, that when all colours are combined,  make up a single image. A typical example of this is referred to as a 4K screen. This screen’s array is made up of a grid of 3840 pixels by 2160 pixels. That's a total of 8294400 pixels!

                        There are a couple ways to use a data projector, depending on the projector itself, your computer and which cables you have at hand. As the demand for increasing quality in video has progressed, so have the ways we interface between the computer and the display. Because of this, the cables used for connecting displays and computers have evolved to better handle the demands placed on them. The first cable used for transmitting video was the composite video cable. This compressed video data into a single cable that comprised a single pin, sending a single stream of data, with a maximum size of 720 × 576 pixels at 50 Frames per second(FPS).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This worked for the standards (like screen size) of the time it was introduced, but if you look back on anything using this cable from the perspective of today's technology, the quality of the moving images displayed is poor. There have been many additions and improvements to video cables over time. Until recent trends in the design choices of laptops emphasising thinness and lightness that have resulted in a reduction in the number of available ports to just one type, that in turn require the use of “dongles” or port replicators to be able to connect additional devices, the two most used video cables were Video Graphics Array (VGA), with a maximum resolution of 2048 × 1536 at 85 FPS and the more recent High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), with a maximum of 10240 x 4320 pixels at 120 FPS, and the additional capacity to transmit high definition sound.

                        Data projectors necessarily require a screen or surface onto which the generated image can be projected, so that it can be observed by humans. But the variety of surfaces, range of distances from projector to screen, and angle of projection relative to the screen will all impact the perceived quality of the projected image. Projectors contain functionality to compensate for these variables, including focus, colour adjustment and keystoning. Keystoning is an unwanted effect that occurs when the angle of projection is acute, resulting in a distorted image, presenting a regular rectangular image as a trapezoid. Projectors  contain software that intentionally distorts the projected image to compensate for the angle of projection. Another common problem faced by projectors is that they need to be mounted upside down at or near the ceiling of a room to achieve the correct size of projection without also creating a hazard by being located in the middle of a room, such as a classroom. To correct for this, projectors will further employ software to flip and image on its horizontal axis, so that it appears the correct way up to observers.

                        The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer. It is made up of three main components; the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which performs calculations, the Registers, which store basic memory and the Control Unit which directs the other units.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CPU carries out all of the instructions to input, process, output or store anything in the computer. It performs these instructions at extremely quick speeds, depending on the hertz of the processor. 1Hz is a measure representing one instruction per second, 3GHz is approximately 3 billion instructions per second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The CPU follows a cycle known as the Fetch-Execute cycle. There are three main stages in the cycle; fetching, decoding and executing. In the fetch stage a new instruction is gathered from Random Access Memory (RAM) in binary form, in the decode stage the CPU determines from the binary which command is to be followed and any inputs, in the execute stage the CPU performs the command and finally the result is placed back in RAM.

                        Generally computer users do not directly interface with the CPU. It is a very fast, very complex machine and is difficult for humans to comprehend and communicate with. Instead the Operating System acts as the manager for the resources in a computer system. It passes the instructions from whichever programs are running to the CPU via the RAM.

                        Similar to the CPU, Commands for the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) are stored in Random Access Memory (RAM). The GPU is a specialist component designed specifically for manipulating images to a piece of memory called the frame buffer which is then pushed to any display devices. The GPU is faster than the CPU for a very specific set of intended actions. They are run in groups and the instructions can be paralleled which means that they are more efficient than CPUs. GPUs have been utilised for calculations that would normally take large amounts of time because of their parallel nature. Some examples of this include deriving digits of pi and cracking codes and passwords.

                        If you upgrade your computer system to improve the GPU software that you run such as VR systems may not immediately use the new hardware. The Operating System needs to be told to use the GPU in settings and drivers.

                    <p>
                        Hard disk drives store data with magnetism. They contain one or more metal platters separated into microscopic segments which can be individually magnetised or demagnetised using a read/write head mounted on an actuator arm. These strings of magnetised and demagnetised sections represent bits, and come together to represent binary strings. These can then be interpreted into text, or images, or any other form  of data on a computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hard Disk Drives are non-volatile which means that they don’t need power to maintain the storage, without a Hard Disk Drive, or other secondary storage device, your computer would not be able to store anything once it was turned off.

                    <p>
                        A computer comes with a secondary storage device to contain the operating system as well as anything the user wants to install or store. A Hard Disk Drive works like any other secondary storage device where the Operating System manages the file system. For example Windows machines have Microsoft Explorer and OSx machines use Finder. Folders can be created to organise related files and a search facility assists with finding the files again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time as files are created and deleted the Hard Disk Drive can become fragmented. This means that there are gaps between used space on the drive and available space. This is a byproduct of the way data is stored and deleted. Data is placed on the disk in consecutive order but when it is deleted it opens up further space for storage. This means that files can be split up and placed badly and storage becomes slow. The operating system has utility software such as a disk defragmenter to assist with this problem.

                    <p>
                        Random Access Memory (RAM) is primary storage that is named for the way it can be accessed. It was designed to be very fast and to be utilised by the CPU. RAM is where the computer stores data it is actively using.  It is volatile memory, meaning without power it loses its data. When opening an executable, the most important functions of the program are stored in RAM for faster access. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Random access refers to the fact that memory can be located using addresses rather than by starting at the beginning of the media and performing a linear search. There are very complex electronics implemented to make this happen.

                    <p>
                        RAM is the short term memory of the computer. It stores what you’re currently working on and you can fill it which slows everything down. Like the CPU, use of the RAM is controlled by the Operating System, but the user has an impact on how much of the RAM is used. If you run a lot of programs at the same time, or have many tabs open in a browser, you may notice that the computer no longer works at full speed. The RAM is probably getting close to capacity. Because RAM is volatile, the best way to clear it out is to save your files, and regularly power down the computer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you find that your RAM is regularly filling with normal use, you can upgrade the amount of RAM or the number of RAM chips depending on the device.
