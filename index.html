                    <h2>What it Does</h2>
                    <p>A mouse translates movement along a surface to movement of the cursor on a computer. An older style mechanical mouse uses a ball which rolls against a series of rollers inside the mouse to detect the direction the mouse is being moved. An optical mouse uses an LED or laser which works with a light sensor and microprocessor. The LED or laser produces light which bounces off the surface. The reflection is detected by the light sensor and the micoprocessor analyses the created image. Changes in the images over time is converted very reliably into movement of the cursor on the screen, translating the direction and speed of the mouse movement. the buttons on the mouse are simple electronic switches that register the clicks and send the data to the computer. The scrollwheel is a potentiometer which changes the resistance in a circuit based on the change of position. All of this data is sent to the computer (through wire or wireless receiver) which is deciphered via the driver files by the operating system.</p>

                    <h2>How to Use</h2>
                    <p>A mouse allows you to interact with programs on the computer by moving a pointer around the screen and click on items to select or choose from a menu. the main affordances of a mouse are moving the pointer, left and right clicking and scrolling. The pointer is a little icon that moves around the screen, changing its look based on the available interactions. It can be moved by sliding the mouse around the surface. if you find that you get to the edge of the surface before reaching the edge of the screen the mouse can be lifted and repositioned. A mouse typically has two or three buttons left and right click and sometimes a scroll button. The left button is used to select, click on hyperlinks, drag and drop and do the most common interactions on the computer. the right click is used for extra options that are contextual for what you are clicking on. The third button is often to be found behind the scroll on the mouse. It is used to use the mouses movement to scroll the page rather than the scroll wheel - it is an accessibility option. Scrolling up or down a page, like on a web page or text document, is done by rolling the scrollwheel in the middle. There is a possibility of extra buttons found on the sides of a mouse. Often the functionality of these buttons is able to be set by the user.</p>

                    <h2>What it Does</h2>
                    <p>A keyboard is one of the most essential input devices to a computer. It was the first and remains the most useful method of interfacing with your computer. It is made up of many small keys that send a signal to the computer when depressed. The most commonly used keys are the alphabet characters and space. The keys are laid out in a specific pattern called "English US QWERTY" (named for the first 6 letter keys). There are also a series of other characters and number as well as some action keys. All of these keys have a specific code as defined by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many different ways that a keyboard can be engineered. One of the most common is a membrane keyboard using a dome switch. Dome switch keyboards use plastic domes to suspend the keys above a circuit board. When the key is depressed the plastic dome is flattened onto the board creating a circuit with conductive material on the underside of the dome. This sends a signal to the processor on the keyboard which converts it to the binary string to send to the computer. With combinations of keys the action key can alter the binary string of the letter key. An example of this is the shift key which alters one bit in the letter binary to switch the capitalisation.

                    <p>Depress a key to send the labled letter or command to the computer connected to it, for example, pressing the 'P' key will type a 'p' in a word prcessor, or could accomplish something else depending on the program.
