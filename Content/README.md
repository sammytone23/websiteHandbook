## Input

### Mouse

- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - A mouse allows you to interact with programs on the computer by moving a pointer around the screen and click on items to select or choose from a menu. the main affordances of a mouse are moving the pointer, left and right clicking and scrolling. The pointer is a little icon that moves around the screen, changing its look based on the available interactions. It can be moved by sliding the mouse around the surface. if you find that you get to the edge of the surface before reaching the edge of the screen the mouse can be lifted and repositioned. A mouse typically has two or three buttons left and right click and sometimes a scroll button. The left button is used to select, click on hyperlinks, drag and drop and do the most common interactions on the computer. the right click is used for extra options that are contextual for what you are clicking on. The third button is often to be found behind the scroll on the mouse. It is used to use the mouses movement to scroll the page rather than the scroll wheel - it is an accessibility option. Scrolling up or down a page, like on a web page or text document, is done by rolling the scrollwheel in the middle. There is a possibility of extra buttons found on the sides of a mouse. Often the functionality of these buttons is able to be set by the user.
    - What it does:
        - A mouse translates movement along a surface to movement of the cursor on a computer. An older style mechanical mouse uses a ball which rolls against a series of rollers inside the mouse to detect the direction the mouse is being moved. An optical mouse uses an LED or laser which works with a light sensor and microprocessor. The LED or laser produces light which bounces off the surface. The reflection is detected by the light sensor and the micoprocessor analyses the created image. Changes in the images over time is converted very reliably into movement of the cursor on the screen, translating the direction and speed of the mouse movement. the buttons on the mouse are simple electronic switches that register the clicks and send the data to the computer. The scrollwheel is a potentiometer which changes the resistance in a circuit based on the change of position. All of this data is sent to the computer (through wire or wireless receiver) which is deciphered via the driver files by the operating system.

### Keyboard

    - 
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Depress a key to send the labled letter or command to the computer connected to it, for example, pressing the 'P' key will type a 'p' in a word prcessor, or could accomplish something else depending on the program.
    - What it does:
        - Each key is it's own key switch  that when depressed, sends a signal to the control chip inboard the keyboard, which then sends it to the computer it is connected to.

## Output

### Data Projector
- Diagram
    - ![Data Projector Diagram](working-of-a-3LCD-projector.png) [3]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - To use a product like this, you must have:
            1. A computer or device to output video
            2. Some sort of cable to transport the video, there are different cables that allow for different quality.
        - To use it you:
            1. Plug the cable into both the Output device and the plasma screen
    - What it does:
        - One lamp projects light into Dichronic mirrors tha separate the light into colours, then these colours are reflected into LCD screens that change the brightness, then theese streams are combined using a prism

### Speaker
- Diagram
    - ![Speaker Diagram](Speaker-Diagram.png) [4]
    - ![Audio Jack Diagram](AudioJackDiagram.jpg) [5]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - To use a product like this you must have:
            1. A computer or device to output video
            2. A speaker
        - To use it you:
            1. Plug the Audio Cable attached to the speaker into the output device
    - What it does:
        - Wattage into the speaker goes through a copper cable surrounding a ring inside a magetised ring, and outside an oppositely magnetised pole. This causes the ring to move up and down, moving a diaphragm which moves the air in sound waves.

## Processors

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Diagram
    - ![CPU Diagram](481px-ABasicComputer.gif) [6]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Commands for the CPU are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory), and are usually used by applications to get the cpu to do calculations.
    - What it does:
        - It makes simple calculations at extremely quick speeds, depending on the hertz of the processor, 1Hz is one calculation per second, 3GHz is approximately 3 billion calculations per second.

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Diagram
    - ![GPU Diagram](1200px-Generic_block_diagram_of_a_GPU.svg.png) [7]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Similar to the CPU, Commands for the GPU are stored in the RAM, but the GPU is faster, as it is used by applications to calculate graphics. it is therefore mainly used by games, or if you want some extremely fast calculations done.
    - What it does:
        - Makes simple calculations at quicker speeds than the CPU, again depending on the Hertz.

## Storage

### HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- Diagram
    - ![HDD Diagram](hdd-diagram.jpg) [8]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - to interface with a Hard disk drive, you connect it to a computer, via the plug connection on hte side, then the operating system should recognise it and allow you to interperet the date stored on it.
    - What it does:
        - Hard disk drives store data with magnetism, magnetising and demagnetising tiny sections on the large disc in side the hard drive, the Platter. these strings of magnetised and demagnetised sections represent bits, and come together to represent binary strings. these can then be interpereted into text, or images, or anything else you can see or hear on a computer.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Diagram
    - ![RAM Diagram](memory-RAM-and-Slot-Diagram.png) [9]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - RAM is used whenever doing anything on a computer. When opening an executeable, the core files of said program are stored in RAM for faster access, and anything else you do is also stored there.
    - What it does:
        - RAM ,or Random Access Memory, is memory used for the task at hand, and requires the computer to be on to store data. The purpose, and namesake of this device is to be used as fast as possible at any time (__Random__ Access memory).
